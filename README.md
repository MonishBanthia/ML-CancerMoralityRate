# ML-CancerMoralityRate



Overview
This project utilizes a Linear Regression algorithm to predict cancer mortality rates based on a Kaggle dataset spanning the years 2000-2014. The dataset offers a detailed perspective on county-level cancer mortality and incidence rates in the United States. The key features include County, FIPS, age-adjusted death rate, average death rate per year, recent trend (2) in death rates, recent 5-year trend (2) in death rates, and average annual count for each county.

Project Highlights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset undergoes thorough exploration to uncover patterns, trends, and potential insights related to cancer mortality rates.

Outlier Removal: Outliers are identified and removed from the dataset to ensure the robustness of the linear regression model.



Dataset Description
County: Name of the county in the United States.

FIPS: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for the county.

Age-Adjusted Death Rate: The death rate adjusted for age to allow for fairer comparisons between populations with different age structures.

Average Death Rate Per Year: The average death rate calculated over the specified time period.

Recent Trend (2) in Death Rates: Information about recent trends in death rates.

Recent 5-Year Trend (2) in Death Rates: Insights into trends over the past 5 years.

Average Annual Count: The average annual count of cancer-related deaths for each county.
